     - Maximum delay from the time BLE_GRANT is deactivated until it is reactivated.

During t\ :sub:`type`\, PTA samples the BLE_PRIORITY line to get the priority of the request.
An active state indicates that the request has high priority.
During t\ :sub:`radio`\, PTA samples the BLE_PRIORITY line to get the direction of the requested radio activity.
The application can configure whether a reception is indicated by an active or inactive state.
All timing diagrams assume that a reception is indicated by an active state.
